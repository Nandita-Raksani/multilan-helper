description: Interview me about a feature and write the spec
argument-hint: spec-file.md
model: opus
---

Interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the questions are not obvious. Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete, then write the spec to $ARGUMENTS.
